A python corss-platform autoclicker. (not yet tested on Linux)

## Features

* Toggle key is Caps Lock (because who really uses it?). Caps Lock is also closer to WASD keys so it's easy to reach
* Anti-bot detection (by randomizing intervals between clicks, in the future i will add buterfly/dracgclick mode for even better stealth)
* Works for both right and left click
